  <media:title>Enter: Naruto Uzumaki</media:title>
  <media:description>After failing to graduate from the Ninja Academy for the third year in a row, Naruto Uzumaki is approached by Mizuki, an instructor at the Academy, who instructs him to steal a scroll with a special technique. Iruka Umino finds Naruto and protects him from Mizuki, but in the process Mizuki tells Naruto the reason nobody seems to like him; The Nine-Tailed Fox Demon that attacked the village twelve years ago was defeated when The Fourth Hokage sealed the Demon inside Naruto, giving his own life in the process. Using the special technique from the scroll, Naruto defeats Mizuki, and Iruka allows him to graduate.</media:description>
